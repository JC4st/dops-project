# Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) – Implementation Guide

This document outlines the principles and practical steps for implementing Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) assessments within a clinical training program, aligning with the guidelines provided by the Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme (ISCP).

## Overview

DOPS is a formative assessment tool designed to evaluate a trainee’s technical, procedural, and professional skills during real-time clinical encounters. It facilitates structured feedback and supports the development of clinical competencies.

## Objectives

- Assess practical skills in an authentic clinical environment.
- Provide immediate, structured feedback to trainees.
- Identify areas for improvement and track progress over time.

## Assessment Process

1. **Selection of Procedure**: Choose a short diagnostic or interventional procedure relevant to the trainee’s level and curriculum.
2. **Observation**: An assessor observes the trainee performing the procedure in a clinical setting, such as an operating theatre, ward, or outpatient clinic.
3. **Evaluation**: The assessor completes a structured DOPS form, rating the trainee across multiple performance domains.
4. **Feedback**: Provide immediate, specific verbal feedback, highlighting both strengths and areas for development.
5. **Documentation**: The completed DOPS form is added to the trainee’s educational portfolio for ongoing review.

## Assessment Domains

Trainees are evaluated in the following domains:

1. Basic understanding of indications, anatomy, and technique.
2. Obtaining informed consent.
3. Pre-procedure preparation.
4. Administration of analgesia or safe sedation.
5. Technical ability during the procedure.
6. Aseptic technique.
7. Seeking help when appropriate.
8. Post-procedure management.
9. Communication skills.
10. Professionalism and consideration of the patient.
11. Overall ability.

## Rating Scale

Each domain is rated using the following scale:

- **Below expectations**: Performance was significantly below the expected standard; major improvement required.
- **Borderline**: Performance was below the expected standard; improvement needed.
- **Meets expectations**: Performance met the expected standard for the trainee’s level of training.
- **Above expectations**: Performance exceeded the expected standard.
- **Not Observed / U/C (Unable to Comment)**: The domain was not assessed during the procedure.

## Frequency and Documentation

- **Regular Assessments**: DOPS should be conducted regularly throughout the training period to monitor progression.
- **Report Review**: All completed DOPS may be used to generate individual reports that help identify areas requiring targeted improvement.
- **Reflective Practice**: Trainees are encouraged to reflect on their feedback and document their learning goals and progress.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Trainees**: Actively seek DOPS opportunities and incorporate feedback into their learning.
- **Assessors**: Provide objective assessments and constructive, actionable feedback.
- **Educational Supervisors**: Ensure that DOPS is integrated into the overall training program and use the collected data to monitor and guide trainee progress.
